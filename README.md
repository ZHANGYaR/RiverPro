These are three matlab app files with three basic functions built in: extracting river longitudinal profiles,
longitudinal profile analysis, and paleochannel projection.
If you want to use these functions in your research, please cite the initial function provenance of the app:
the RiverProAnalysis function set. Citation Format:
